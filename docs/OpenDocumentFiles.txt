When changing an open document, please convert from .od? to an expanded
directory (they are zip files) that can be properly monitored with git diffs.
As each document is changed it should be converted in a single commit before
the commit with the next change. A script needs to be written or obtained to
automate this during the commit process. Then the files could remain as odt in
the "checked out" version. When this is done, this file should be adjusted to
reflect the current state of documentation version control storage. Having the
documents stored in this way will allow convention diff tools to be used to
compare versions in detail, which isn't possible as it currently stands.
