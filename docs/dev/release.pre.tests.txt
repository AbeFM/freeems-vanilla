Practical tests to be performed to ensure no regression prior to each release :

Code :
grep -rn "~0x[0-9][0-9];" src
This should be done after make and before clean to ensure that no macros etc expand into notted 8 bit literals.

Comms :
Drop each type of packet through and ensure the correct response. There should be a packet type for each and every code path created.
