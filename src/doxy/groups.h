 * @brief Doxygen module groups definition
 *
 * @note The order of group definitions within this file determines the order
 * of them on the modules page so place new groups accordingly.
 */

/** @defgroup globalHeaders Global Headers
 *
 * These key files are included in most source files by default.
 *
 * @b Examples:
 * - Global defines
 * - Global constants
 * - Global variables
 * - Error codes
 * - Device header
 * - Struct typedefs
 */

/** @defgroup dataInitialisers Data Initialisers
 *
 * These files provide initial data definitions for items that live in flash.
 *
 * @b Examples:
 * - Tables
 * - Tunables
 * - Fixed config
 * - Lookup tables
 * - Global constants
 */

/** @defgroup measurementsAndCalculations Measurements And Calculations
 *
 * These files all operate on inputs in order to eventually generate outputs.
 *
 * @b Examples:
 * - ADC readings
 * - Core variable generation
 * - Core variable averaging
 * - Derived variable generation
 * - Fuel calculations
 * - Ignition calculations
 */

/** @defgroup allHeaders All Header Files
 *
 * Most of these are fairly uninteresting, hence being clost to the bottom of
 * the modules list. Typically they just contain function declarations for
 * inclusion in other source files.
 */

/** @defgroup doxygenDocFiles Doxygen Documentation Files
 *
 * These files exist purely to contain documentation for extraction
 * by Doxygen. Using this grouping keeps them off the file list.
