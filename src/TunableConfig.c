/**	@file TunableConfig.c

	Copyright 2008 Fred Cooke

	This file contains the definition of the primary set of tunable
	configuration data. This set is enabled by default and is normally
	what you want to adjust while tuning the engine. It is also what
	is in use when the table switching mechanism is enabled and not
	engaged. If you are not using the table switching feature it is
	wise to configure all values in the secondary set to be exactly
	the same as what is in this set. This way if you have table
	switching turned on and the input pin is floating you will not
	get erratic engine behaviour. The declaration can be found in the
	global constants header file.

	Please ensure that any items added to the struct type definition
	have appropriate defaults added here also. See the documentation
	for SmallTables1 for more details.
