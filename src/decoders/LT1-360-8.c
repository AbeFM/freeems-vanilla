 * @brief LT1 Optispark
 *
 * Uses PT1 to interrupt on rising and falling events of the 8x cam sensor track.
 * A certain number of 360x teeth will pass while PT1 is in a high or low state.
 * Using that uniquek count we can set the positing of your Virtual CAS clock.
 * After VCAS's position is set set PT7 to only interrupt on every 5th tooth, lowering
 * the amount of interrupts generated, to a reasonable level.
 *
 * @note Pseudo code that does not compile with zero warnings and errors MUST be commented out.
