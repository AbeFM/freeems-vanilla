figures for inner above are wrong due to offset LEDs in CAS body!!!! Find offset value and adjust these figures. Note this in docs re disk pattern and actual pattern.

34 cam degrees or slightly less (inner degrees earlier than on disk.

use #define and let the compiler take care of the math so that its easier to change.

Logic:

const unsigned short eventCrankAngles[] = {0, 60, 180, 240, 360, 420, 522, 540, 600, 652}
measured values with compression effect = {0, 73, 184, 257, 367, 436, 530, 545, 612, 671}
                            differences = {0, 13,  14,  17,   7,  16,   8,   5,  12,  19}
the above needs verify on init to ensure order is sequential!
unsigned char array pinEventNumbers[6] = {} // 6 pins, which even should they go on? 255/0xFF = not fired. populated by scheduler in main loop
^ only good enough in short term, in longer term, could expect same pin to fire on multiple events in a cycle...

event number, pin number

if(synced){

if inner fires, increment, then event should be  6th or 9th (zero index)
if outer fires, increment, then event should be 0th - 5th, 7th, 8th. If 9th make equal 0th, not 10th

only outer needs check for 9th > 0th, inner will catch based on not 6th/9th/rising/falling.

for either:

take last period, and last angle gap, calc ticks per degree or similar, generate limits, compare measured with limits, drop sync if wrong.

else if(not synced){ look for logic as per below:

ten transitional events total per engine cycle:

5 provide sync:

if inner = off to on, position = 522 degrees
if inner = on to off, position = 652 degrees

if outer = on to off AND inner = on, then position = 600
if outer = off to on AND inner = on, then position = 540
if outer = off to on AND is third while inner = off, then position = 360

information of no use for obtaining sync:

outer on to off and is third while inner = already synced by definition
other four outer events are not identifiable as anything specific and therefore cant sync

Loss of sync:

Lose sync if time between one event and next is not within allowable range, or if ordering of inner/outer events is not correct.
Possibility of ignoring narrow pulses in order to be noise tolerant, but this comes with risk.

Summary:

Sync obtainable for 292 degrees of crank rotation and not for remaining 428 degrees

worst case is 428 degrees of rotation before sync/injection/ignition, average case is 214 degrees rotation, best case is instant sync.

temporary pin sched code:

for(pin 0 - 5){
	if(pinEventNumbers[pin] == event){
		firePin(pin, delayFromEventInTicks);
	}
}

Checking tooth timing! :

record time stamps from all events outside of IF conditions, and before sync,
and set flag saying that stamp is valid such that when the first sync point is
found we MIGHT be able to get an RPM instantly and verify the second event
timing when it arrives, rather than one later. This concept could be extended
to record the previous two, but not yet...

record time stamps, set stamp valid flags
record periods, set period valid flags
once synced, compare recorded data with expected history, drop sync if not, so will never get sync if noisy, great!


WARNING: THESE CONTAIN COMPRESSION EFFECTS!!!
