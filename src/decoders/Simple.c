 *
 * @brief Reads any signal that is once per cylinder
 *
 * This file contains the two interrupt service routines required for to build
 * cleanly. However, only the first one is used due to the simple nature of it.
 *
 * The functional ISR just blindly injects fuel for every input it receives.
 * Thus a perfectly clean input is absolutely essential at this time.
 *
 * Supported engines include:
 * B230F
