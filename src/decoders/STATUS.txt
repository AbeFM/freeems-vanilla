Decoder implementation development status:

Listener             - 100% Complete - Test ONLY. No thread, it just prevents math code from running, allowing a perfectly smooth LA log to be taken.
BenchTest            - Functional, as documented, to be improved and extended later. http://forum.diyefi.org/viewtopic.php?f=56&t=1180
EvenTeethOnCam-Nand1 - Functional, but incomplete. http://forum.diyefi.org/viewtopic.php?f=56&t=1099
HyundaiHack          - Functional, but incomplete. http://forum.diyefi.org/viewtopic.php?f=56&t=1082
MitsiCAS-4and1       - Functional, but incomplete. http://forum.diyefi.org/viewtopic.php?f=56&t=1078
LT1-360-8            - Functional, but incomplete. http://forum.diyefi.org/viewtopic.php?f=56&t=1100
NipponDenso          - Not functional, does not represent its name well.  No thread, yet.
MissingTeeth         - Probably broken, untested since interface changes. No thread, yet.
Simple               - Probably broken, untested since interface changes. No thread, yet.

Files needing renames:

 - GenericMissingTeethWheelBase.c - currently not functional, needs to be replaced completely and named BaseGenericMissingTeeth-Both-XmY.c 
 - Generic4Cylinder-HallOrOptical.c - currently hard coded to 4 cylinders, support up to 12 and provide headers for each. Names in the form HallOrOptical-Distributor-<CylinderCount>of<AngleOfEach>.c where AngleOfEach is the crank angle spent high/low for each cylinder's signal
 - Simple.c - currently hard coded to 4 cylinders, support up to 12 and provide headers for each. Names in the form SingleEdgeVR-Distributor-<CylinderCount>.c
 - NipponDenso.c - currently very old broken code, needs reimplementing with a 3 pin strategy. Name likely to be NiponDenso-Both-12a1a1.c
 - MitsiCAS-4and1.c - waiting for some work using old name before rename to MitsiAndMazda-CAS-4and1.c
 - MissingTeeth-36-1-Crank-Only.c - Change to MissingTeeth-Crank-36m1.c
