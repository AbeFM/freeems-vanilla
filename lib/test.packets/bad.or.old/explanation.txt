All packets are zero byte padded for formatting reasons and also to ensure that we can grab the start out of the middle of a stream.

Force Escape : This packet has a sum of 0x55 and therefore a total sum on
resend of 0xAA which will need to be escaped. The returned packet should be
two bytes longer with an extra checksum and an escape for it.
